We plan to collect an amount of AED 50,000 from our good-hearted, generous people to make this mission accomplished and very happy to say that a few of our members have already been voiced their willingness to ANRIA  committee.No doubt, it will be an everlasting benchmark for ANRIA and a real pride for all of us.
